            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6">3. Use of Project Data</h2>
            <p class="mb-6">All materials and information shared with SearchSerpa as part of a project are treated as confidential.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
              <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Data, content, and communications provided by clients are used only to fulfill the agreed scope of work.</li>
              <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Project data is securely managed through Bloom.io, our primary client and project portal. Bloom.io serves as a central hub for communication, reporting, and project tracking.
              <p class="mt-2">Supporting documentation and internal records may also be stored in Notion, used as an auxiliary data workspace connected to our systems for organization and workflow management.</p></li>
              <li><strong>Access:</strong> Only authorized SearchSerpa team members directly involved in your project have access to related information or assets.</li>
              <li><strong>Automation:</strong> Limited data may pass through Zapier or n8n.com to automate workflows such as notifications, report delivery, or task management. These automations do not analyze or share client content.</li>
              <li><strong>Anonymized Use:</strong> Aggregated, de-identified project data (such as campaign statistics or performance summaries) may be used internally for performance review, training, or educational purposes — never in a way that identifies clients.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p class="mt-6">We uphold strict confidentiality standards to ensure that all client and project information remains private, secure, and used only for its intended purpose.</p>
